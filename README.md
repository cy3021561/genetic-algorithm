## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. The Genetic Algorithm is used to efficiently approximate the optimal solution for larger instances of the TSP.

## How it Works

The Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic search technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It starts by generating a population of random routes, where each route represents a potential solution to the TSP. The algorithm then applies a series of evolutionary operations, including selection, crossover, and mutation, to iteratively improve the routes over multiple generations. Through this iterative process, the algorithm converges towards an optimal or near-optimal solution.
